Arduino library for Parallax RFID readers

Overview:
---------

This project is a free initiative to create an Arduino library for Parallax RFID readers. 
The main goal is to provide a library that simplifies the usage of these particular readers in Arduino projects.

Features:
---------
  * Read data from RFID card
  * Write data to RFID card


Library Usage:
--------------
  * Download the source
  * Place the "ParallaxRFID" folder in your Arduino1.0+ "libraries" folder
  * Open example sketch: "file", "Examples", "ParallaxRFID", "ParralaxRFIDRead" (or "ParralaxRFIDWrite")
  * Connect the RFID reader (default pins for RX/TX are 6, 8 (also connect Vcc and GND)
  * Compile & upload code
  * The reader should be printing status info on the serial monitor as described in the examples
  
How it all Works:
-----------------
  * Coming soon

Version History:
----------------
  * Version 0.1: Basics working (read + write)

Roadmap:
--------
 * Version 0.3: Better examples
